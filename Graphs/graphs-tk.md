Graphs
what is a graph? 
- a collection of data represented by nodes and connections between nodes 
- Trees can be considered a graph

Different components that can be required to make up graphs
- nodes or vertices - represent objects in a dataset
- edges - connections between vertices
- weight - cost to travel across an edge


What are graphs useful for? 
- a city or some type of location. (ex represent all different stops, all different trains could take from one location to another)
- Github (github uses graphs to represent git history)
- Social networks, networks of cell towers

Types of graphs
- Directed (can only move in one direction along edges)
- Undirected graph (allows movement in both direction along edges also known as bidirectional)
- Cyclic graph - edges allow you to resvisit at least on vert(example water cycle)
- acyclic graph - vertices can only be visited once (example recipes)


Summary
- Graphs are a set of vertices and edges that connect those vertices
- we can use graphs to represent a variety of different networks or related pieces of data
