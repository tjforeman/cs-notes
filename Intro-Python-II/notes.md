# Problem solving framework

#### [Documentation](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/CS-Wiki/wiki/Lambda-Problem-Solving-Framework)

- Understand - What is the problem asking me to do? 

- Plan - What steps will I take to solve the problem? 

- Execute - How do I implement those steps?  

- Reflect - Is this implementation as good as I can make it? 

Understanding and planning will take the vast majority of the time when it comes to problem solving. What code is written already? What resources do I have? What are all the different ways I can attack this problem?
