# code up an inventory system for a store, the store can have multiple departments.
# each department can hold multiple products. 

# do we need a store type? No
# How many departments <10000
# how man products <1000000
# what departments will there be 
# how much space to store unlimited
# access restrictions none 
# product description name, price, count
# product count? 
# product location isle 
# web/mobile command line
# can a product be in multiple departments maybe later but start with no 
# what kind of reporting?
